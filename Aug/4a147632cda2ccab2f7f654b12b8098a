Looking for a different camping experience? Rustic wooden cabins have been added to the overnight options at three Northern California state parks. VIsitors will find four new cabins each at Patrick’s Point State Park, north of Eureka; Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, east of Crescent City; and Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park, about 50 miles north of Eureka. And the rustic part? The unfurnished cabins sleep six in bunk beds (bring your own bedding and mattress pads). There’s no kitchen or cooking inside the cabin, but you’ll find a barbecue and fire pit outside as well as a picnic bench. Each cabin comes equipped with electricity, heaters and lights. Cabins cost $80 a night to rent. You can reserve one by going online at ReserveAmerica or call (800) 444-7275.
