Michael Jackson still lives in Las Vegas, sort of. The 10-foot statue the King of Pop created for his 1995 “HIStory” album cover was recently installed in the lobby of the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino. Dancers from “Michael Jackson ONE,” the Cirque du Soleil production staged at the resort, performed at the unveiling on July 28. Fans will recognize the statue made by Diana Walczak. It depicts Jackson as a monumental warrior-like figure. It’s the third piece of memorabilia to go on display at Mandalay Bay. The hotel also exhibits the military-style, red-and-and gold jacket Jackson wore at the 1984 American Music Awards, and a pair of his iconic black loafers, complete with crystal-encrusted white socks, in which he danced. They are on display in a case adjacent to the Michael Jackson ONE boutique. The items are on loan from the Estate of Michael Jackson indefinitely, a news release says.  What’s next? As part of the resort’s celebration of what would have been Jackson’s 58th birthday — he was born Aug. 29, 1958 — a fourth item from the King of Pop’s collection will go on display Aug. 27. What that will be remains under wraps. Visitors can see the Jackson items on display in Mandalay Bay at no charge. MORE Remember the Age of the Showgirl?
