Have a howling good time on a trip to Narvik, Norway, where you will stay at the new Wolf Lodge and ride a gondola up a mountain to hunt for the aurora borealis. The four-day, three-night tour, organized by Off the Map Travel, includes a stay at a lodge in the wolf enclosure at Polar Park. Guests are separated from the animals only by the lodge’s wooden walls and oversized windows. The stay also includes a supervised, face-to-face wolf kiss (or not!) with the park’s socialized wolves. The northern lights experience takes guests by gondola to the top of Narvik Mountain where they can watch for the lights indoors in a lodge or from a viewing platform outside. Dates: Tours are available November through March. Price: From $3,150 per person, based on a group of four traveling together. Included are transfers, three nights’ accommodation, including one night at the Wolf Lodge, a boat trip along the fjord to search for wildlife, and a guided aurora borealis hunt. Air fare is not included. Info: Off the Map Travel at www.offthemaptravel.co.uk or www.ILoveNorthernLights.com, 011-44-0-800-566-8901, email info@offthemaptravel.co.uk.
