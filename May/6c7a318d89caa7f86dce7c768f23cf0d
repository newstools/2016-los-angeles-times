The Linq Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas has rolled out rooms with bunk beds so fifth wheels won’t be left out of your party plans — and they start at $69 a night. Twelve rooms at the Linq have been outfitted with two queen-sized beds and an additional loft-style twin bunk. It’s perfect for a party of five; other rooms at the hotel have a limit of four guests. I checked availability online for Memorial Day weekend when room prices are high. Total cost of a three-day holiday stay in a bunk bed room (Friday through Monday) for five would cost $838, including resort fee and taxes. That pencils out to a pretty reasonable $167 each for the entire stay. Midweek prices are lowest. For example, I found availability for a bunk bed room July 7 through 12 for $328, including resort fee and taxes — or $65 each. Bunk bed rooms also have USB charging stations, a flat-screen TV, refrigerator and rain-shower shower head (no tub). You and your besties can hang at the pool, shop at the Promenade, take a spin on the High Roller ($23 by day, $36 by night) or rent board games like Twister and Yahtzee. And when you arrive, you can use a self-check-in kiosk if you don’t want to wait in line. As for location, you’ll be right on the Strip, between the Flamingo and Harrah’s hotel resorts.
