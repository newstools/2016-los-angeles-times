Cycling fans may want to see Oahu on two wheels by registering for the 35th Honolulu Century Ride from Waikiki Beach along the east coast to Kaaawa and back. Riders may choose to ride 25, 50, 75 or 100 miles. Those who opt for the century ride start near the Kapiolani Park bandstand before pedaling through Hawaii Kai and along the beaches of the island’s south shore.  From there, riders head about two-thirds of the way up the east side to Kaaawa before turning around. Along the way, participants pass through the communities of Waimanalo (where President Obama and his family vacation) and Kaneohe. The ride begins at 6:15 a.m. Sunday. Aid stations will be located along the route, and cyclists can get help with any mechanical fixes they may need.  You may register online with a suggested donation of $105 for adults and $35 for kids. A family Fun Ride with 9- and 18-mile options begins at 9 a.m. Only a handful of Honolulu hotels provide bikes for guests, but rentals are easily arranged if you want to participate. Vendors such as the Bike Shop and Hawaiian Style Rentals rent bikes for as little as a half-day or as long as a week.  Info: Honolulu Century Ride
